  "name": "Bioinformatics Club at Simon Fraser University",
  "tagline": "This is a new club that hopes to provide an environment for students and other academics to come together to talk about their work related to Bioinformatics. This club is meant for people at all stages of the learning curve of Bioinformatics. You can come and share questions that you may have of your research and/or of somebody else's research. And we hope to bring guest speakers to help us figure out the more problematic subjects of Bioinformatics. ",
